# GitLab CI Monitor

Monitor the latest build status with colored LEDs using an Arduino board
running Firmata.

## How it works

The script periodically polls the GitLab API and retrieves the last build
status, then:

- the green led is turned on if the build is successful
- the yellow led is turned on if the build is in progress or pending
- the red led is turned on when the build is failed
- on the first failure a long buzz is emitted
- when the buid is successful again two short buzzes are emitted

## How to run

Ensure that Bundler is installed:

    $ gem install bundler

Install the required gems:

    $ bundle install

Get an API private token from GitLab by visiting
[your profile page](https://gitlab.com/profile/personal_access_tokens).

Create a `.env` file with the following content:

```shell
export GITLAB_API_PRIVATE_TOKEN="your token here"
export GITLAB_PROJECT_ID="your project id here"
```

Ensure that your Arduino is connected and that LEDs and buzzer
are connected to the right pins (check the `LedMonitor` class).

Finally, just launch the script:

    $ ./monitor.rb

If you want to enable debug output, lauch with:

    $ DEBUG=1 ./monitor.rb

The monitor checks the build status on the `develop` branch.
You can specify a time interval in seconds, the default is `120` (two minutes).
For example, to poll the build status every five minutes:

    $ ./monitor.rb 300

## Notes

I quickly wrote the script and it basically suits my need.
